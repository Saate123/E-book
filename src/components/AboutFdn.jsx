                The Griot Foundation is a cultural and healing initiative
                founded by Linda Somiari-Stewart to reconnect African children
                and youth with their roots through the power of storytelling. In
                a world where identity is fading and values are being lost, we
                return to the ancient fireâ€”where stories once taught us who we
                are, how to live, and why we matter. Through folktales,
                mentorship, healing programs, and cultural education, we raise a
                generation that remembers their worth, walks in dignity, and
                carries the story forward.
